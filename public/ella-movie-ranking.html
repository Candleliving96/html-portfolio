        <h1>The Best Movies According to Ella</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
        <p>Hilarious and fun. Anna Kendrick is crush-worthy.</p>

        <h3>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</h3>
        <p>It's not often that a sequel is better than the original, but this one is.</p>

        <h3>Totally Killer</h3>
        <p>The perfect combination of thrilling and absurd. What more could a horror movie want?</p>
